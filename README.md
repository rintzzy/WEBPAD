#WebPad :: a rich text editor for web
=================================

![SCREENSHOT] (https://github.com/rintzzy/WEBPAD/blob/master/wp.png)

1. What is it?

 -> A rich text editor for web, based on the javascript Rich Text API.

2. Why WebPad?
 
 -> In the talking of rich text editor, GMail, Yahoo, Outlook pops up in our mind first. They are powerful. Also, there are some built-in rich text editor which
    comes in as out-of-the-box package in some front-end frameworks(e,g. UIKit). While these rich text editors generally fulfils the most common often needed
    formatting tasks such as, highlight portion of text, hyperlinking, inserting image etc., how about you'd want to transform your text? You can do it here.
    Also you can export your draft to a html file. 	

3. API Used in the app

 -> a) JavaScript's Rich Text API
    b) W3C FileSave API

4. Known issues 

 -> a) Google Chrome has not implemented CSS3 syntax of text-decoration property. That's why underline function won't work in Chrome.
    ** A previous accessibility issue in Chrome has been fixed
5. Future of this project

 -> I have thoughts to modify it to be a full fledged editor with HTML and markdown syntax.
 
*Underline other than default, won't get displayed in Chrome version > 34 because of a bug.*
